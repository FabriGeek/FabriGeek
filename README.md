- 👋 Hi, I’m @FabriGeek
- 👀 I’m interested in tinkering with microcontrollers, specifically Arduino & ESP32.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Visual Studio Code, Platformio and GitHub, as well as learning more about C++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment; need to learn how to crawl before I can walk.
- 📫 How to reach me
